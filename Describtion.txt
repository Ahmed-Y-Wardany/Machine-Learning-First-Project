# Student Performance Prediction Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Student Performance Prediction Dashboard is an interactive web application that leverages machine learning to predict academic performance across three core subjects: Mathematics, Reading, and Writing. Built with Streamlit, this dashboard provides educators, administrators, and researchers with valuable insights into factors influencing student achievement.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Prediction System**: Three specialized linear regression models for accurate score prediction in each subject area
- **Interactive User Interface**: Intuitive form-based input system with real-time validation
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: 12 demographic, familial, and academic factors considered for predictions
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive bar charts comparing predicted scores across subjects
- **Performance Interpretation**: Intelligent scoring system with performance categorization (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Streamlit for responsive web interface
- **Visualization**: Native Streamlit charts for score comparisons
- **Layout**: Two-column responsive design with organized input sections

### Backend
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn Linear Regression models
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib/Pickle for model serialization
- **Validation**: Input normalization and score boundary enforcement (0-100 range)

### Data Features

The prediction system analyzes 12 key factors across four categories:

1. **Demographic Factors**:
   - Gender
   - Ethnic Group

2. **Family Background**:
   - Parent Education Level
   - Parent Marital Status
   - Birth Order (First Child status)

3. **School Environment**:
   - Lunch Type (Standard/Free-Reduced)
   - Test Preparation Completion
   - Transportation Means

4. **Academic Habits**:
   - Sports Practice Frequency
   - Weekly Study Hours
   - Existing Subject Scores (for cross-subject predictions)

## Model Specifications

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Training Data**: Comprehensive student performance dataset
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom encoding schemes for categorical variables
- **Prediction Range**: Normalized scores between 0-100
- **Model Accuracy**: Optimized for educational prediction scenarios
